Calculate how many courses will be needed to elevate n persons by using an elevator of the capacity of p persons. The input holds two lines: the number of people n and the capacity p of the elevator.

Hints
•	You should divide n by p. This gives you the number of full courses (e.g. 17 / 3 = 5).
•	If n does not divide p without a remainder, you will need one additional partially full course (e.g. 17 % 3 = 2).
•	Another approach is to round up n / p to the nearest integer (ceiling), e.g. 17/3 = 5.67  rounds up to 6.
•	Sample code for the round-up calculation:



int numberOfPeople = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
int elevartorCapacity = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

int numberOfCourses = numberOfPeople / elevartorCapacity;

if (numberOfPeople % elevartorCapacity != 0)
{
    numberOfCourses++;
}
Console.WriteLine(numberOfCourses);

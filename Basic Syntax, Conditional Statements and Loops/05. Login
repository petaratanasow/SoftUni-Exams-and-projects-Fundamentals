On the first line, you will be given a username and your task is to try to log in the user. The user's password is the username reversed. On the next lines, you will receive passwords:
•	If the password is incorrect, print "Incorrect password. Try again.".
•	If the password is correct, print "User {username} logged in." and stop the program.
Keep in mind that if the password is still incorrect on the fourth attempt, you should print: "User {username} blocked!".
Then the program stops.
